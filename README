How to run the code:

1. Make sure you are inside the pacman directory in the command line
2. Copy paste one of the commands from the pacman_commands.txt file into the
terminal. (these were all of the commands used for testing)
3. Each command includes the board layout, which is a randomized board
    layout for where the food, pacman, and walls are located, three for each
    board size. Each 3 board sizes are averaged in the data.

-Weights:

The weights can be changed inside the searchAgents.py file for each of the
relevant search algorithms, within the search agent constructor.

-Heuristics:

The heuristics are given as a list inside the appropriate agents. The
heuristics used can be changed here. (note if new heuristic is added to the
list it must be implemented).

Algorithms and Heuristic Code:
-MHA_star_algos.py contains the MHA* algorithms written for the project
-search.py has A* and WA* code in it
-searchAgents.py is where each algorithm's search agent class is located
-pacman_heuristics.py is where all the heuristics we used are located
Note: We didnt hook up the weights or the heuristics to the command line which would
be more convenient but would have taken a lot of time to figure out the pacman
code to make it work.
